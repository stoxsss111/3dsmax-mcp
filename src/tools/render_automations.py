"""Render-done signal ("the pinger") for 3ds Max — completion detection only.

A production render blocks Max's main thread (and the bridge with it), so
"finished" can't be learned by asking Max, and polling Max just lags the
viewport. The native bridge registers Max's own NOTIFY_POST_RENDER and writes a
small signal file at the exact completion event (render_handlers.cpp).

This tool does NOT fire the render. Firing a render from the bridge made Max
loop (a second render auto-starting after the first finished), so firing now
lives entirely outside the bridge. You trigger the render yourself — hit Render
in Max, or run ``execute_maxscript`` with ``max quick render`` — and this tool
only reports when it finishes:

  * ``start``  — arm the done-signal for the NEXT render (reads Render Setup for
                 the report; records the signal path). Returns a ``signal_path``
                 and a ready-to-run background ``watcher`` command. Does NOT
                 render — trigger the render yourself right after arming.
  * ``status`` — read that one signal file (never touches Max).
  * ``cancel`` — raise the render abort flag (works mid-render).

The waiting is an external, event-driven watcher (scripts/render_signal_wait.ps1)
the agent runs in the background; it exits when the signal lands, pinging the
agent to continue. Nothing the bridge does starts a render.

    This does NOT start the render — firing a render from the bridge made Max

    watch_timeout_sec caps the watcher (default 3600; 0 = wait forever). On cap
    it prints {"status":"timeout"} and exits 2 — check action=status before
